## Credits

This project is a fork of [xnafan/SimpleTileWorld](https://github.com/xnafan/SimpleTileWorld), which itself is the result of me asking [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/tot7lw/drawing_tilemaps_using_systemdrawing_via_winforms/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Reddit.

The loop functionality comes from an adaptation of [this tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/@dewetvanthomas/tutorial-game-loop-for-c-128ovxgrig).

And as the original project, uses some of the re-purposed graphics fromToen's Medieval Strategy Sprite Pack.
